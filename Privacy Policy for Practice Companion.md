# **Privacy Policy for Practice Companion**

**Effective Date:** April 19, 2025

This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Practice Companion Android application ("the App").

**Developer:** Kailuo Wang

**1\. Introduction**

Practice Companion is an application developed by Kailuo Wang. This policy is intended to clearly inform you about the data practices of this App.

**2\. Data Collection**

Practice Companion is fundamentally designed to respect your privacy. **The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or usage data from its users.** This means we do not gather your name, email address, device identifiers, location data, or any other information that could identify you. We do not track how you use the App, and there are no analytics or reporting mechanisms that send data off your device.

**3\. Data Storage**

Any information you create, input, or manage within Practice Companion, such as practice sessions, notes, or settings, is stored **exclusively on your device**. This data remains local to your phone or tablet and is not accessed by, transmitted to, or stored on any external servers, including those of the developer or any third parties. When you uninstall the App, this locally stored data may be removed, subject to your device's operating system and your uninstallation process.

**4\. Permissions**

\[**Optional Section:** Include this section ONLY if your app requires specific permissions (e.g., storage access to save/load data). If it requires no permissions beyond basic function, you can state that here or omit the section.\]

Example if Storage permission is needed:  
The App may request permission to access your device's storage. This permission is solely utilized for the purpose of saving and loading your practice data directly onto your device's local storage. This data is not accessed or transmitted externally by the developer.  
**5\. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are encouraged to review this policy periodically.
